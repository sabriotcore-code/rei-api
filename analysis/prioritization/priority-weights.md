# Priority Weights and Scoring Methodology

## REI Collections Operations - Opportunity Prioritization

### Executive Summary

This document defines the priority weights and scoring methodology used to rank opportunities in REI's collections operations. The algorithm employs a weighted multi-criteria approach focusing on measurable business impact, implementation feasibility, financial returns, and strategic alignment.

### Scoring Criteria and Weights

#### 1. Impact (Weight: 30%)
**Primary Focus**: Business impact on collections efficiency and customer experience

**Key Factors**:
- **Revenue Recovery Potential**: Ability to improve collection rates and reduce bad debt
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Enhancement of customer experience during collections process
- **Process Efficiency**: Reduction in manual effort and processing time
- **Risk Reduction**: Minimization of compliance, operational, or reputational risks

**Scoring Guidelines**:
- Score 9-10: Transformational impact across multiple dimensions
- Score 7-8: Significant improvement in primary collections metrics
- Score 5-6: Moderate improvement with measurable benefits
- Score 3-4: Limited impact or benefits unclear
- Score 1-2: Minimal or questionable impact

#### 2. ROI - Return on Investment (Weight: 30%)
**Primary Focus**: Financial benefits and cost-effectiveness

**Key Factors**:
- **Cost Savings**: Direct operational cost reductions
- **Revenue Increase**: Additional collections or recovered accounts
- **Implementation Cost**: Total cost of ownership including development, deployment, and maintenance
- **Payback Period**: Time to recover implementation investment

**Scoring Guidelines**:
- Score 9-10: ROI > 300%, payback < 6 months
- Score 7-8: ROI 150-300%, payback 6-12 months
- Score 5-6: ROI 75-150%, payback 12-18 months
- Score 3-4: ROI 25-75%, payback 18-24 months
- Score 1-2: ROI < 25%, payback > 24 months

#### 3. Feasibility (Weight: 25%)
**Primary Focus**: Technical and operational implementation viability

**Key Factors**:
- **Technical Complexity**: Development effort, system integration requirements
- **Resource Availability**: Team capacity, skill sets, external dependencies
- **Timeline Constraints**: Realistic implementation schedule
- **Dependencies**: Requirements on other projects or system changes

**Scoring Guidelines**:
- Score 9-10: Low complexity, resources available, no major dependencies
- Score 7-8: Moderate complexity, resources mostly available
- Score 5-6: Some complexity or resource constraints
- Score 3-4: High complexity or significant resource gaps
- Score 1-2: Very high complexity or major blockers

#### 4. Strategic Alignment (Weight: 15%)
**Primary Focus**: Alignment with REI strategic objectives and long-term goals

**Key Factors**:
- **Strategic Priority Alignment**: Support for key business initiatives
- **Collections Workflow Integration**: Enhancement of core collections processes
- **Data Accuracy Improvement**: Contribution to data quality and analytics
- **Long-term Value Creation**: Sustainable competitive advantage

**Scoring Guidelines**:
- Score 9-10: Direct support of top strategic priorities
- Score 7-8: Strong alignment with business objectives
- Score 5-6: Moderate strategic value
- Score 3-4: Limited strategic alignment
- Score 1-2: Minimal or unclear strategic value

### Weight Rationale

#### Why Impact and ROI are Highest (30% each)
- **Business-Critical**: Collections operations directly impact cash flow and customer relationships
- **Measurable Results**: These criteria provide quantifiable success metrics
- **Stakeholder Priorities**: Executive leadership emphasizes measurable business outcomes
- **Resource Allocation**: Limited resources require focus on highest-value opportunities

#### Why Feasibility is Second (25%)
- **Execution Risk**: Even high-value opportunities fail if implementation is unrealistic
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited technical and operational capacity requires realistic assessment
- **Timeline Pressures**: Business needs often have specific deadlines
- **Success Probability**: Feasibility directly correlates with project success rates

#### Why Strategic Alignment is Lowest (15%)
- **Immediate Needs**: Collections operations often require tactical improvements
- **Operational Focus**: Day-to-day efficiency often outweighs long-term strategy
- **Measurability**: Strategic alignment is more subjective than other criteria
- **Time Horizon**: Strategic benefits may not materialize within planning periods

### Adjustment Factors

#### Risk Multipliers
- **High Risk**: 0.8x multiplier (20% reduction)
- **Medium Risk**: 0.9x multiplier (10% reduction)
- **Low Risk**: 1.0x multiplier (no adjustment)

#### Urgency Bonuses
- **Critical**: +0.5 point bonus
- **Urgent**: +0.3 point bonus
- **Normal**: No bonus

#### Complexity Penalties
- **High Complexity**: -0.4 point penalty
- **Medium Complexity**: -0.2 point penalty
- **Low Complexity**: No penalty

### Tier Definitions

#### Tier 1: High Priority (8.0-10.0)
**Characteristics**:
- Exceptional impact and ROI potential
- High feasibility with available resources
- Strong business case with executive support
- Clear success metrics and timeline

**Action**: Fast-track for immediate implementation

#### Tier 2: Medium Priority (6.0-7.9)
**Characteristics**:
- Good business value with acceptable feasibility
- Positive ROI with reasonable implementation effort
- Supports business objectives with manageable risk
- Can be delivered within 6-month timeframe

**Action**: Include in quarterly planning cycle

#### Tier 3: Low Priority (4.0-5.9)
**Characteristics**:
- Limited business value or challenging implementation
- Uncertain ROI or long payback period
- Requires significant resources or has dependencies
- May conflict with higher-priority initiatives

**Action**: Consider for future roadmap, monitor quarterly

#### Tier 4: Deferred (1.0-3.9)
**Characteristics**:
- Minimal business value or very high risk
- Poor ROI or unfeasible implementation
- Significant resource requirements without clear benefits
- Conflicts with strategic priorities

**Action**: Archive or require fundamental changes

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Scoring Process
1. **Data Collection**: Gather quantitative and qualitative inputs for each criterion
2. **Cross-functional Review**: Include collections, IT, finance, and strategic planning teams
3. **Scoring Session**: Structured evaluation with documented rationale
4. **Validation**: Cross-check scores against historical performance data
5. **Approval**: Final scoring requires sign-off from collections leadership

#### Quality Assurance
- **Calibration**: Regular comparison with actual project outcomes
- **Bias Check**: Rotate scoring team members to reduce individual bias
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test impact of weight adjustments on rankings
- **External Validation**: Periodic review by independent consultants

#### Maintenance Schedule
- **Monthly**: Review and update opportunity scores
- **Quarterly**: Reassess weights and tier definitions
- **Annually**: Comprehensive methodology review and calibration
- **Ad-hoc**: Update for significant business changes or new strategic priorities

### Success Metrics

#### Algorithm Performance
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Correlation between scored opportunities and actual outcomes
- **Resource Utilization**: Efficiency of resource allocation based on rankings
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Acceptance and trust in prioritization decisions
- **Business Impact**: Measurable improvement in collections operations metrics

#### Collections Operations KPIs
- **Collection Rate Improvement**: Percentage increase in successful collections
- **Cost per Collection**: Reduction in operational cost per collected account
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Improvement in post-collections survey scores
- **Processing Time**: Reduction in average time per collections case
