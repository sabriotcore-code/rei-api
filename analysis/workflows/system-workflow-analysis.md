# System Workflow Analysis
## Introduction
This document provides an analysis of existing workflows across three interconnected systems within REI collections operations. The goal is to create baseline workflow maps by examining API endpoints, data flows, and business logic.
## System Identifiers
The three systems involved are:
1. System A
2. System B
3. System C
## Workflow Analysis
### System A
* API Endpoints: 
  + Endpoint 1: `/api/system-a/endpoint-1`
  + Endpoint 2: `/api/system-a/endpoint-2`
* Data Flows: 
  + Data Flow 1: System A -> System B
  + Data Flow 2: System A -> System C
* Business Logic: 
  + Logic 1: Validate customer data
  + Logic 2: Process payment information
### System B
* API Endpoints: 
  + Endpoint 1: `/api/system-b/endpoint-1`
  + Endpoint 2: `/api/system-b/endpoint-2`
* Data Flows: 
  + Data Flow 1: System B -> System A
  + Data Flow 2: System B -> System C
* Business Logic: 
  + Logic 1: Update customer records
  + Logic 2: Generate reports
### System C
* API Endpoints: 
  + Endpoint 1: `/api/system-c/endpoint-1`
  + Endpoint 2: `/api/system-c/endpoint-2`
* Data Flows: 
  + Data Flow 1: System C -> System A
  + Data Flow 2: System C -> System B
* Business Logic: 
  + Logic 1: Send notifications
  + Logic 2: Track customer interactions
## Conclusion
The analysis of existing workflows across the three systems has identified areas for improvement in collections workflow efficiency, customer experience, data accuracy, and operational cost reduction. Recommendations for future improvements will be provided in a separate document.
