# Infrastructure Specifications
## Introduction
The rei-api automation project requires a robust infrastructure to support the automation scripts and ensure reliable execution. The infrastructure specs will outline the necessary components and configurations.
## Infrastructure Components
The following infrastructure components are required:
* Cloud-based virtual machines (VMs) for automation script execution
* Containerization using Docker
* Orchestration using Kubernetes
* Load balancing and scaling using AWS ELB and Autoscaling
* Monitoring and logging using Prometheus and Grafana
## Infrastructure Configuration
The infrastructure will be configured as follows:
* VMs will be provisioned with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Docker installed
* Docker containers will be used to run automation scripts
* Kubernetes will be used to orchestrate container deployment and scaling
* Load balancing and scaling will be configured using AWS ELB and Autoscaling
* Monitoring and logging will be configured using Prometheus and Grafana
