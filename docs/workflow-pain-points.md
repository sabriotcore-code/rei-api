# Workflow Pain Points and Inefficiencies

## Introduction
This document outlines the current workflow pain points and inefficiencies in the PME Master Sheet collections data management process. The goal of this audit is to identify areas for improvement and provide actionable insights to enhance collections management effectiveness.

## Inefficiencies and Manual Processes
The following areas have been identified as potential inefficiencies and manual processes that could be automated:
* Manual data entry and updates for BALANCE, LAST_PAYMENT, and STATUS fields
* Inconsistent terminology and severity ratings used by agents
* Lack of automated notifications and reminders for tenant tracking workflows

## System Limitations
The following system limitations have been identified as impacting collections management effectiveness:
* Limited data analytics and reporting capabilities
* Inability to track and manage tenant communication and interactions
* Insufficient scalability and performance to handle growing collections data

## Recommendations
Based on the identified inefficiencies and system limitations, the following recommendations are made:
* Implement automated data entry and updates for BALANCE, LAST_PAYMENT, and STATUS fields using scripts or integration with existing systems
* Develop a standardized terminology and severity rating system for agents to use
* Integrate automated notifications and reminders for tenant tracking workflows using existing communication channels
* Develop and implement data analytics and reporting tools to provide insights into collections management effectiveness
* Enhance system scalability and performance to handle growing collections data

## Next Steps
The next steps will be to prioritize and implement the recommended changes, and to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the improvements.
