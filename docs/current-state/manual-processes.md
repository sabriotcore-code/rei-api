# Manual Processes
## Introduction
The current state of the collections process involves several manual steps and interventions across multiple systems, including PME, QUO SMS, and Gmail. This documentation outlines these manual processes, identifies bottlenecks, and maps user intervention points.
## Manual Processes Between Systems
1. **Data Entry**: Manual data entry into the PME Master Sheet for new collections cases.
2. **Communication Initiation**: Manual initiation of communication with clients through QUO SMS for payment reminders and updates.
3. **Email Workflows**: Manual setup and management of email workflows in Gmail for collections-related communications.
## Bottlenecks and User Intervention Points
* **Data Synchronization**: Manual data synchronization between PME and QUO SMS leads to potential data inconsistencies and bottlenecks.
* **Communication Delays**: Manual communication initiation through QUO SMS can lead to delays in payment reminders and updates.
* **Email Workflow Management**: Manual email workflow management in Gmail can be time-consuming and prone to errors.
## Current State Process Flow
The current state process flow involves the following steps:
1. Data entry into PME Master Sheet
2. Manual data synchronization with QUO SMS
3. Communication initiation through QUO SMS
4. Email workflow setup and management in Gmail
5. Manual intervention for payment tracking and follow-up
