# Integration Testing Strategy
## Introduction
The integration of PME Master Sheet, QUO SMS, and Gmail aims to create an automated collections process. This document outlines the testing approach for system integration, data synchronization validation, and end-to-end workflow testing.
## Testing Approaches
### System Integration Testing
* Verify that data is correctly exchanged between PME, QUO SMS, and Gmail.
* Test API connectivity and authentication.
* Validate data formats and schema compliance.
### Data Synchronization Validation
* Verify that data is accurately synchronized between systems.
* Test data consistency and integrity.
* Validate data mapping and transformation rules.
### End-to-End Workflow Testing
* Test the entire workflow from data ingestion to automated collections processes.
* Verify that manual override capabilities function correctly.
* Validate workflow scalability and performance.
